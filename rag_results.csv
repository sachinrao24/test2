About the Organization

Earth's oceans are what give our planet its identity - the blue planet, the watery globe. They are the cradle of life, the region with the highest level of biodiversity we know, an irreplaceable source of food, a source and a storage chamber in world-scale chemical and energy cycles, the engine of earth's climate. The oceans determine the nature and quality of the biosphere far beyond their coastlines. They are the sustaining, all-encompassing element in the global biosphere.

The Lighthouse Foundation supports integrated and long-term approaches in the relationship between humans and the marine environment within the context of sustainable development.

About the Grant

In accordance with the orientation of the LF, projects and measures must have a maritime theme and be suitable as models for follow-up projects and measures in other regions of the world. They must be of such a nature as to make people in other regions receptive to the theme and make a concrete contribution to an enhanced awareness of the maritime world.

Receptivity for and an awareness of sustainable development should not be narrowed down to sustained utilization of maritime resources. The important thing is to make it clear that the natural world in its biological and physical phenomenology is of value per se and cannot be reduced to the isolated aspect of satisfaction of human needs.

The usefulness and visibility factor of a pro­ject or meas­ure are closely re­lated in the view of the LF. A high pro­file and wide­spread dis­sem­in­a­tion of in­form­a­tion on activ­it­ies gen­er­ate the kind of pos­it­ive at­ten­tion and curi­os­ity mari­time themes and prob­lems de­serve. What we need to eval­u­ate a pro­ject or meas­ure is a clear-cut de­scrip­tion of the con­tri­bu­tion it will make.

Coastal regions are the target regions for meas­ures and pro­jects geared to sus­tained de­vel­op­ment in the mari­time field. The eco­lo­gical land/​sea bound­ary is at the same time the hu­man/​sea in­ter­face and thus the fo­cal point of the rel­ev­ant eco­lo­gical, eco­nomic and so­cial chal­lenges.

Interdisciplinary and inter-sector activities con­sti­tute the most prom­ising ap­proaches for ini­ti­ation of sus­tained de­vel­op­ment pro­cesses in the mari­time field. The con­cerns of re­gional pop­u­la­tions must be a cent­ral fo­cus and local per­son­al­it­ies should be en­gaged as driv­ing forces be­hind the activ­it­ies.

Methods of project realization: Both the meth­ods and or­gan­iz­a­tion em­ployed by in­sti­tu­tions and per­sons re­spons­ible for the pro­jects or meas­ures must re­flect the prin­ciple of sus­tain­ab­il­ity.

Regional developmental impulses: Pro­jects and meas­ures aim­ing at co-op­er­a­tion on re­gional de­vel­op­ment must gen­er­ate clearly defined and re­cog­niz­able de­vel­op­mental im­pulses within a pat­ently re­gional frame­work. The ob­ject­ive must be to im­prove the liv­ing con­di­tions of the re­gional pop­u­la­tion in a sus­tain­able man­ner and to con­trib­ute dir­ectly to a palp­able re­duc­tion of re­source con­sump­tion.

Exemplary function: Pro­jects and meas­ures geared solely to an in­di­vidual situ­ation with little rel­ev­ance to wider circles can only be ap­plied to other situ­ations in other re­gions at con­sid­er­able ex­pense. The higher the ex­em­plary pro­file of a pro­ject or meas­ure, the greater its util­ity for the seas and oceans on a global scale.

Synergistic effects: Pro­jects and meas­ures that are to re­ceive fin­an­cial as­sist­ance from the LF must also take into ac­count com­mit­ments from other donor or­gan­iz­a­tions. Re­dund­an­cies in donor work must be avoided, al­though by the same token the activ­it­ies of other donors can cer­tainly be in­teg­rated to cre­ate be­ne­fi­cial syn­er­gistic ef­fects.

Utilization of financial means : The LF al­ways con­siders fin­an­cial aid in terms of the scope and fo­cus of the res­ult­ing con­tri­bu­tion to Found­a­tion goals and to a solu­tion of the es­sen­tial prob­lem as for­mu­lated in the pro­ject ap­plic­a­tion.

About the Organization

The Munich Re Foundation was established in 2005 to mark the 125th anniversary of its founder. Munich Re has been dealing with global risks since 1880. Anyone with so much knowledge also bears responsibility. Those who act responsibly must share their knowledge. With the Munich Re Foundation, Munich Re assumes this responsibility. Based in Munich, the foundation is active worldwide, especially in emerging and developing countries.

Munich Re concerns itself with the great challenges facing the world today – population growth, globalisation, diminishing resources, environmental pollution, climate change.

About the Grant

Devastating floods in Brazil in April 2024, widespread flooding in Kenya in May 2024, massive floods in southern Germany and Austria in June 2024, accompanied by very early, very hot heatwaves in India, China, the south-west of the USA and south-east Europe show one thing very clearly: disasters caused by climate hazards are striking more frequently and more intensely around the world. In order to mitigate the worst consequences, we need to take countermeasures with risk management instruments. Disaster risk reduction (DRR) is of particular importance. UNDRR and the Munich Re Foundation are putting the RISK Award at the service of disaster risk reduction and are launching the 2025 RISK Award – Call for Applications.

Apply now for the 2025 RISK Award, endowed with a project funding of up to €100,000!

Topic 2025: ""Children and youths as agents of change for DRR""

Disasters don't discriminate, yet some people are more at risk! This statement is becoming increasingly true. Analyses of the numbers of victims and people affected prove: countries in the Global South are more affected than countries in the Global North, and vulnerable people, such as marginalised groups, children, young people, women, people with disabilities and more, suffer disproportionally. Data from UNDRR shows that over 1 billion children have had their lives disrupted by disasters since 2000, with more than 80,000 schools damaged or destroyed. According to UNICEF, approximately one billion children worldwide are at extremely high risk due to climate impacts, including climate-related disasters.

To address this injustice, we are dedicating the 2025 RISK Award to the topic of ""Children and youths as agents of change for DRR"". It is important to understand that children and young people are not only ""victims"", but also have great potential to become risk managers themselves. They can contribute to their own safety, as well as that of their families and communities, in a variety of ways. This can happen through education and raising awareness, participation in DRR planning and decision making, community engagement as well as youth advocacy, amongst other approaches. Everyone is called upon to participate in disaster risk reduction, so if you are involved in disaster risk reduction projects for and with children and young people, this RISK Award is aiming at you. Our target region is developing and emerging countries in the Global South.

About the Grant

The Chemistry for Climate Action Challenge is one of the Elsevier Foundation’s flagship partnerships. Together with Elsevier’s Chemistry journals, the Elsevier Foundation provides funding of 25,000 USD for 2 winning projects per year, implementing green & sustainable chemistry solutions in the Global South – advancing both Climate Action (SDG 13) and Gender Equity (SDG 5).

Challenge Criteria:

Proposals need to have all the criteria described below, namely have a strong green & sustainable chemistry component, using a novel approach for a solution to an urgent problem, be applicable in and suitable for low- and middle-income countries, replicable, scalable, sustainable and, have an impactful gender component.

Projects will be reviewed according to the criteria below:

The proposal clearly describes the urgency of the problem.

Provide a description of the project background and include a description of the broader context, the urgency of the problem, and highlight how the project links to the United Nation Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Particularly describe how the project links to SDG13 Climate Action and the sub-targets of this SDG such as: strengthening resilience to climate-related hazards, improve education and awareness, address the needs of low- and middle-income countries. Additionally, describe if and how the project interlinks with other SDGs (e.g., SDG3 Good Health and Well-being, SDG5 Gender Equality, SDG15 Life on Land, etc.), resulting in co-benefits.

The project utilizes innovative green and sustainable chemistry and chemical sciences approach, for example:

CO2 reduction and utilization, cleaner production, energy conversion and storage Reduces or eliminates the use or generation of one or more hazardous substances or materials;

More sustainable use of resources and cleaner low energy production;

Increase reuse or recyclability of chemicals/product;

Designs a new business model related to the circular economy.

The project is replicable, scalable, sustainable (make sure to specify why), and sets a benchmark for innovation – new ideas or concepts in development will be given preference over more advanced projects.

The proposal highlights the novelty of your approach and gives a short literature overview of what has been done before, both by you and others (“background”).

The project is applicable in and suitable for low- and middle- income countries. Describe the project’s social impact on local communities, including gender equality either in design or implementation.

The project must have an impactful gender component, and if relevant describing the sex/gender dimensions of the research.

Another helpful reference is ‘Toolkit for Integrating Gender-Sensitive Approach into Research and Teaching’, developed by GARCIA in collaboration with a number of universities (i.e., Radbound University, University of Trento, Université Catholique de Louvain etc.). Additionally, Gendered Innovations (Stanford University) provides practical methods of sex, gender and intersectional analysis for scientists – and offers case studies as concrete illustrations of how this analysis leads to innovation.

The project must include an implementation plan. Please note that if the project has been developed in a high-income country, contextually appropriate knowledge transfer to the lower income country is needed to be demonstrated, for instance through a developing country implementation or research partner(s). If the idea presented is already patented, it will not be eligible.

The project must also disclose a full and detailed budget plan in USD highlighting any funding already raised and plans to close any funding gap between the prize money of USD 25,000 and your total budget costs.

6,Applications Invited for Post-discharge malaria chemoprevention,"Unitaid
",Not mentioned,https://ngobox.org/full_grant_announcement_Applications-Invited-for-Post-discharge-malaria-chemoprevention-Unitaid_12561,04/11/2024,"

About the Organization

Millions of people in low- and middle-income countries are dying every year from preventable, treatable diseases because they can’t access the lifesaving health products they need. Unitaid was created to address this inequality.

We save lives by making new health products available and affordable for people in low- and middle-income countries. We work with partners to identify innovative treatments, tests and tools, help tackle the market barriers that are holding them back, and get them to the people who need them most – fast.

Since we were created in 2006, we have unlocked access to more than 100 groundbreaking health products to help address the world’s biggest health challenges, including HIV, TB, and malaria; women’s and children’s health; and pandemic prevention, preparedness and response. Every year, more than 300 million people benefit from the products we’ve helped roll out.

About the Grant

Under this Call, Unitaid is soliciting proposals for the following intervention, aimed at accelerating implementation and generating evidence to catalyse the adoption and scale-up of PDMC to address the burden of childhood anaemia and malaria:

Multi-country implementation of PDMC with robust evidence generation that responds to key knowledge gaps to inform future guidance and accelerate uptake.

Projects should include implementation projects, delivered in diverse representative settings, to generate robust, transferable evidence on the impact, operationalization, and cost/cost-effectiveness of PDMC delivery – with a vision to informing national scale-up.

These strategies should be tailored to specific country contexts, including sub-national approaches and different delivery platforms (such as community health worker or facility-based delivery approaches). Projects will need to assess key barriers to PDMC delivery and implement activities that establish an enabling environment to support PDMC uptake – including supporting supply chains, human resources, national guideline updates, and pathways to scale.

Evidence generation through the projects should seek to respond to research needs identified by WHO and country implementers, such as, at-scale adherence using different delivery approaches, optimal coordination mechanisms, long-term impact, effectiveness of PDMC in different target groups (such as those presenting to hospital for causes other than severe anaemia) and for different intervention durations in different contexts, and cost of different delivery approaches.

Strategies should include assessment of PDMC feasibility in settings that are implementing other malaria prevention and strategies. Integration with other childhood health strategies, such as holistic management of severe anaemia of different causes, use of multiple micronutrient or iron supplementation, and nutritional or bacterial infection prevention interventions could also be considered.

Strong proposals will demonstrate early coordination with multi-disciplinary national programs, regional bodies, civil society, and global partners. Efforts should be made to secure buy-in and funding for transition to scale through the life of the project.

Proposal requirements:

Proponents should clearly describe their overall project design with a Theory of Change, showing how it meets the objectives of the initiative and how the proposed activities form part of a coherent whole. Proposals should explicitly state what impact will be achieved within the project lifetime, as well as what, and how, lasting impact will be achieved.

The proponent should clearly demonstrate strong expertise in the intervention areas needed to undertake the project, including the implementation of large-scale multi-country projects of this nature, and robust evidence generation. Broad collaboration with relevant stakeholders will be vital to achieving the project objectives, including effective coordination mechanisms and well-articulated partnerships. Proponents should clarify the key stakeholders with whom they will engage, and how this will be achieved. It is important to include a country engagement model that outlines coordination and cooperation with countries in decision making around tailoring the design of elimination programs, monitoring introduction, and assessing impact. By actively involving government stakeholders in all phases of planning and implementation, projects will gain valuable insights into local contexts, policy frameworks, and stakeholder priorities. This collaboration will lead to more informed and effective project design, increased buy-in from government partners, and greater sustainability of project outcomes beyond the grant funding period.

Applicants should be clear about the underlying assumptions made in their proposed approach and should highlight any major risks or other factors that may affect the delivery of results. Finally, proposals are expected to outline a lean, concrete, and clear pathway to results and impact.

Additional information:

Unitaid considers working with communities a critical part of generating demand and strongly encourages adopting inclusive approaches, and the early and continued meaningful engagement of communities towards improving the lives and health of the most vulnerable people. The role of affected communities and planned collaborations with other relevant groups including grassroots community organizations and Civil Society Organizations at all stages of a project/programme including ideation is essential, with this engagement a key determinant for success. Activities should be clearly budgeted in proposal submissions. Community-led approaches are important to consider and adequately fund and resource when designing, planning, implementing, and evaluating activities and programmes.

Unitaid will prioritize proposals from South-based lead implementers with experience in implementation and expertise in the technical and market intervention areas needed for the project. Additionally, Unitaid supports the meaningful inclusion of South-based sub-implementers, where feasible and relevant, in proposed project implementation consortia. Unitaid’s objective of progressively engaging an increased number of lead implementing partners from the global South does not preclude proposals that are led by or including partners from the global North. In all cases, we encourage coordination and collaboration across implementors and seek proposals with regional impact across key low- and middle-income countries’ markets and a clear path to global impact.

Unitaid is committed to climate and environmental action in its investments and expects its partners to make similar commitments. Proposals should clearly indicate: (i) Efforts that will be made to minimize carbon emissions from project activities; (ii) Potential opportunities to contribute to broader climate and/or environmental co-benefits, in synergy with core project objectives. More detailed guidance and definitions are provided in the proposal template.

Proposals should demonstrate value for money and measurable impact. Proposals should also include analysis of pathways to impact, scalability, and sustainability of key interventions.

Single-country interventions are out of scope for this Call for Proposals.

About the Organization

This foundation seeks, through cultural arts, to develop the infrastructure and create an environment that will nurture people's creativity and expressive power, to create a spiritually rich society that can accept emotional connections, mutual understanding and respect, and diversity, with the aim of supporting the activities of the most talented young cultural artists, to pass on and develop the culture arts that have been cultivated thus far, and to promote the imagination of new and original cultural art.

About the Grant

At this age of globalism, Japanese artists are actively working in broad areas both domestic and abroad, and increasing numbers of grants and awards that support such artists’ activities have developed over the recent years. In such condition within the international art field, Socially Engaged Art, which aims to realize a better society through direct artist involvements with communities and societies, are attracting increasing attention among their approaches towards various controversies such as environmental issues, economic discrepancies, immigrant issues, and more others. In Japan however, Socially Engaged Art is not yet well renowned, and no particular system could be found up until this point that support such activities. Taking into account of such condition, Kawamura Arts and Cultural Foundation will start a new grant system in which would be the first case to support Socially Engaged Art in Japan. We hope this grant system would contribute in attaining a broader understanding of Socially Engaged Art along with its social meanings and possibilities, and intensify the activities and practices of artists who aim to realize a further better society towards the future.

SOCIALLY ENGAGED ART SUPPORT GRANT will support Socially Engaged Art projects that will take place in Japan and commit to the community and society; implement activities together with communities and residents; and aim to build and demonstrate models of a better society. This would further enhance in-depth relationships between art culture and the society and will contribute in cultivating higher cultural developments in Japan.

Grant amount and number of grantees:

JPY 1,000,000 to 2,000,000: 1 grantee

JPY 300,000 to 500,000: approximately 2 to 10 grantees

About the Organization

EFICO Foundation is a private, non-profit foundation created in 2003 by Patrick F. Installé, late member of EFICO’s founding family. It is one of a kind in Europe in terms to structurally support coffee farmers and their families.

Today, about 40 roasters joined the EFICO Foundation, several governmental organisations participate financially or through their development agencies in projects, together with more than 60 different organisations.

All supported funding goes integrally to the projects, and EFICO commits to cover the operational costs of the Foundation. This gives you a unique way to make sure that 100% of your support goes directly to the projects.

About the Grant

Through training and education programs, sustainable income increase, resilience for climate change, infrastructure support, and natural resource protection, we work to positively impact coffee farmers’ livelihoods, prosperity and environment.

Projects are selected by an independent jury of experts and the funds are managed independently and transparently within the EFICO Fund by the King Baudouin Foundation.

The EFICO Foundation provides a flexible tool to build a sustainable supply chain: support by sourcing coffee with EFICO contributing 0.25 EUR/kg or direct transfer to the EFICO Fund.

With our activities of the EFICO Foundation, we are active in our commitment to the principles of the UN Global Compact and to the Sustainable Development Goals.

EFICO Fund -

In 2005 EFICO established the EFICO Fund within the King Baudouin Foundation, to monitor the administrative and financial operations of the EFICO Foundation. It gathers money from several sources of revenue (institutions, donations, coffee roasters, sales of EFICO Foundation labelled coffee) to allocate to projects. The fund consists of a Jury of experts that carefully select the projects and a Board that approves this selection.

The King Baudouin Foundation is a transparent, independent and public interest foundation, which supports projects and citizens committed to building a better society. As a Belgian organization, KBF also has a European and international scope. EFICO itself covers all the operational and fund-related expenses. 100% of the funds collected are destined for the projects.

The EFICO Foundation projects are being deliberated by a Board and a Jury.

The Board, appointed by the King Baudouin Foundation: decides on the allocation of the EFICO Fund’s financial resources, appoints the Jury members, launches requests for new projects, follows the EFICO Fund’s operations.

An independent Jury of experts, appointed by the Board: selects and monitors the EFICO Foundation projects, evaluates its partners.

About every 3 years, we organize a project initiation round.

Our focus areas are knowledge transfer, sustainable income increase for farmers and resilience to climate change.

The project must aim to:

improve the living conditions of coffee producers and their communities

meet 3 dimensions of sustainability: social, environmental and economic and the set out pre-determined criteria.

Preference is given to projects having a clear strategy to become self-sustaining and creating a leverage effect. We encourage to apply innovation and having the potential to inspire a broader community by creating a model that can multiplied.

The promoter must show to what extent the project will succeed, through its implementation, in applying the multi-stakeholder model as developed by the UN Global Compact.

The project should substantially contribute to one (or more) of the Sustainable Development Goals and be able to measure progress against these SDGs.

The Foundation supports efforts that test new ideas and approaches that promote public health, with a special emphasis on reproductive health and family planning and their integration with other health promotion activities. It favors community-level disease prevention and health promotion projects and efforts that help strengthen regional and country public health systems over disease diagnosis, treatment, and care provided by clinics, hospitals, and humanitarian aid programs.

Activities that help increase capacity include applied research, program development, technical assistance, and training projects that:

Promote reproductive health and family planning.

Address issues related to mental and behavioral health.

Address issues relating to pollution and environmental health.

Increase the understanding of zoonotic and neglected tropical diseases.

Address issues relating to nutrition and health.

Key Priorities:

In all of its areas of interest, the Foundation gives priority to projects that have the potential to advance the field, build local capacity, promote replication, influence public opinion and policy, affect systems change, and benefit people beyond the immediate project and its local context.

Grant Size

There is no minimum or maximum grant size. It is anticipated that most grants will fall in the $25,000-$50,000 per year range.

Grants are made for a one- or two-year period. Second-year funding is conditional on the provision of a satisfactory progress report, interim financial report, and work plan. Renewal requests for projects that were not originally approved as a multi-year project may be considered, but require a new application.

Grant awards are made twice a year, once in the spring and once in the fall, with applications due several months prior. Timelines are publicized on the website in advance and may differ slightly from year to year.

The Foundation will consider only one proposal from an organization in any calendar year.

Eligibility

The Foundation supports local, state, and regional organizations in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Latin America, and the Middle East in the countries where the projects are based. It also supports organizations located in upper-income countries working with local partners in these areas. It does not support projects in post-Soviet states or Balkan states.

Most types of organizations that can provide evidence of their non-governmental status or charitable purpose are eligible to apply, including non-governmental organizations, nonprofit organizations; civil society organizations; community-based organizations; and colleges, universities, and other academic institutions.

Government agencies and religious organizations may be included as project partners but are not eligible for direct funding.

How to Apply

Submit your online concept application on or before January 1 or July 1 to ask for an invitation to submit a proposal for the foundation’s May or November meetings. The deadline is the next business day if the 1st is on a weekend or holiday. We will notify you if we invited a proposal within a month of the deadline. Send in only one application per review cycle.

",Grant Amount: 2000000 USD,https://ngobox.org/full_grant_announcement_Applications-Invited-for-Development-of-devices-and-drugs-for-fully-automated-insulin-delivery-at-meals-Breakthrough-T1D_12548,17/09/2024,"

About the Organization

Founded in 1970 by families whose loved ones had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (T1D), Breakthrough T1D is a tax-exempt nonprofit 501(c)3 organization. As the leading global type 1 diabetes research and advocacy organization, we help make everyday life better while driving toward cures. We are opening doors that were once closed by T1D diagnosis. We lead the way to more effective solutions by connecting the brightest minds to advance treatments, influence policy, and improve access to care.​ By driving innovation forward, we will make T1D a thing of the past.

About the Grant

Breakthrough T1D is a longstanding supporter of automated insulin delivery (AID) systems. Today’s commercially available AID systems are hybrid closed loop (HCL), meaning they require manual management of insulin dosing around meals, exercise, and other events that cause significant changes to glucose levels. Fully closed loop (FCL) systems that automate insulin delivery with no need for manual input from the user can reduce the burden of living with T1D and achieve superior glycemic outcomes. Toward the ultimate goal of achieving completely FCL AID systems, Breakthrough T1D invites letters of intent to develop technologies to allow for automated insulin delivery at meals.

Background:

Today there are a number of AID systems commercially available globally. These HCL systems significantly improve glycemic outcomes and reduce the burden of diabetes management. However, the quality-of-life improvements conferred by today’s AID systems are limited by the requirement for manual user inputs to handle glucose changes associated with meals. Systems that can fully automate insulin delivery around meals promise to improve the experience of people already using AID systems and encourage others to try AID systems for the first time. Additionally, the vagaries of insulin action and glucose metabolism make it nearly impossible for users to perfectly calculate and time insulin doses before meals, and meal boluses are frequently late or missed altogether, especially among adolescentsi . Thus, for many, automated insulin delivery around meals is expected to improve glycemic outcomes like HbA1c and time in range.

Several types of technologies hold promise to achieve automated insulin delivery around meals. One is algorithms that can either anticipate or quickly recognize meals and deliver appropriate insulin boluses. Another is adjunctive (i.e. non-insulin) therapies that can diminish and/or delay post-prandial glucose excursions; insulin-pramlintide co-formulations fall into this category. A third approach is ultra-rapid insulin (URI). Currently available subcutaneous insulins lag behind endogenously produced insulin in both onset and offset of activity, leading to post-prandial glucose excursions and delayed hypoglycemia. A sufficiently fast-acting subcutaneous URI has the potential to enable an algorithm to cover mealtime glucose excursions without a meal announcement. These three approaches are not mutually exclusive, and ultimately the best AID system with automated delivery around meals may require a combination of advanced algorithms and drugs. This RFA is intended to solicit projects to develop AID systems that are fully automated around meals, or the individual components that comprise them.

Product features:

This RFA is intended to support the development of AID systems, or components of an AID system, with the following features:

No user interactions, even simple meal announcements, required for adequate coverage of typical meals and snacks

AID systems must manage mealtime glucose excursions while mitigating the risk of delayed hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia

The system must not impose additional burdens on users (for example, additional external wearables), and would ideally improve upon current levels of usability.

AID systems developed for a target population that includes people not currently achieving recommended glycemic targets, rather than just the most highly engaged users already achieving optimal glucose outcomes, will be prioritized. For example, new systems should be minimally complex, and trials should include people currently achieving suboptimal glycemic outcomes (e.g. high A1c, low time in range), as feasible

Objectives:

Letters of intent (LOIs) are sought from academic and industry applicants to develop AID systems with the features listed above, or to develop components of such systems (e.g. rapid-acting insulins) that will be incorporated into AID systems in the future. Examples of research appropriate for this RFA include, but are not limited to:

Preclinical development of URIs, either novel insulin analogs or existing analogs in novel formulations, designed to be “fast-on, fast-off”. While the ultimate goal must be incorporation into an AID system, Breakthrough T1D will consider supporting development efforts that must be completed first, such as pharmacokinetic studies in animal models outside the AID context. URIs in any stage of development are eligible for funding, but priority will be given to projects supporting insulins that have been validated in animal models.

Clinical development of URIs, including trials to investigate pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and/or assess efficacy in an AID context without meal announcements.

Clinical development of adjunctive therapies that normalize prandial blood glucose excursions, alleviating the need for announcements of meals. Adjunctive therapies may be either co-formulated with insulin or stand-alone products, and may be designed for T1D or repurposed from other indications.

Clinical development of AID algorithms that forego the requirement for meal announcements. Only trial-ready algorithms with strong preliminary data (e.g., from simulations or previous clinical trials) will be considered for funding.

Clinical development of an AID system composed of more than one of the above approaches (URI, adjunctive therapy, algorithm).

Trials in populations most likely to clinically benefit from full mealtime automation of insulin delivery.

Trials of AID systems with full automation at mealtime focused on capturing measures of user experience in addition to blood glucose and other clinical endpoints.

Other innovative approaches aligned with the goal of developing AID systems with full automation around meals.

Examples of research not covered by this RFA include:

Development of technologies that will enable improved HCL systems requiring meal announcements.

Decision support tools that require user input.

Development of systems to enable fully automated delivery of insulin only around exercise or other periods of rapid glycemic change, and not meals.

Development of glucose responsive insulins.

Deliverables

• Projects should be designed to achieve key inflection points appropriate to project duration, budget, and initial stage of development.

Applicants are encouraged to consult with the Breakthrough T1D Scientific Staff below to discuss the alignment of their proposal to this RFA and to develop the projected study concept.

Critical considerations:

Projects must address automated insulin delivery around meals. Projects that address automated insulin delivery around exercise and other events that disturb glucose levels in addition to meals will also be considered

Clinical trials testing AID systems that handle meals without user input should capture endpoints around user experience when appropriate for the trial design. Collaboration with experts in patient reported outcomes (PROs) is essential.

Breakthrough T1D strongly encourages applications from industry.

About the Organization

The Minor Foundation for Major Challenges (MFMC) is a Norwegian foundation that supports communication projects which advance the transition to a low carbon economy.

Priorities:

The foundation’s priorities for the 2019-2023 period are to:

encourage and support innovation in climate communication

increase the number of voices and narratives in climate advocacy

help strengthen social and political movements that open up for radical change

concentrate on supporting European proposals

About the Grant

We support new and unexpected ways of communicating the need for transitioning to a low-carbon economy.

We want to finance projects that inspire us. Many charitable funders will avoid unproven techniques, high-risk projects, or audiences not reached by normal campaigns, but those things are what we’re here for.

In light of MFMC’s Full Funding Strategy, the Board will review all applications against the following questions:

Describe the systemic change you are seeking to create

Why are you the right group or organisation to achieve this change?

Why is your project needed at this exact moment?

The Minor Foundation supports European-based organisations and communication projects that:

Lead to changes in policies or practises in public or private institutions in line with pathways for 1,5C

Increase knowledge and implementation of needed policies and technologies

Reduce new build out or use of fossil fuels

Increase the uptake and use of carbon-free solutions

Create positive mobilisation for the actions and policies needed to keep global warming within the pathway of 1,5C

Increase the number of voices and narratives in climate advocacy

MFMC traditionally announces six calls for applications every year, in two different categories: large and small grants.

Large grants: In this category, MFMC is looking for projects typically in the range of EUR 20,000 to EUR 200,000, although larger projects may be considered. The application process consists of two steps, where interested organizations are asked to initially submit a short pitch. Based on this, the organization may be invited to submit a full application if the MFMC board finds the project appealing.

Small grants: In this category, it is possible to apply for smaller grants of up to EUR 10,000 in a simplified one-stage process. Applications will be assessed by the MFMC board based on its aims and strategy.

About the Organization

We’re driven to build incredible things that connect people in inspiring ways.

Because we can’t truly advance groundbreaking AI alone, we share our research and engage with the AI community to advance the science, together.

Whether it be in AI Infrastructure, Generative AI, NLP, Computer Vision or other core areas of AI, our focus is to connect people in inspiring ways through collaborative, responsible AI innovation.

About the Grant

In October 2023, we announced the inaugural Llama Impact Grants program—a global call for proposals to source innovative use cases of Llama, our open source AI models, to address critical global challenges in areas like education, the environment, and open innovation. Today, we’re excited to announce that applications are open for the next iteration of this program, the Llama 3.1 Impact Grants, through which we’ll award a total of up to $2 million USD. We’re seeking proposals that use the new features and capabilities of Llama 3.1 to explore how these tools can be deployed for economically and socially impactful projects.

We believe AI has more potential than any other modern technology to increase human productivity, creativity, and quality of life—and to accelerate economic growth while unlocking progress in medical and scientific research. To help realize this potential and help organizations around the world leverage the benefits of open source AI, we’ve expanded our grant program to a portfolio of grants, awards, hackathons, and community building to showcase how open source AI can promote social and economic progress. We’re inspired by the diverse projects we’ve seen developers undertake around the world to positively impact their communities by building with Llama.

We’re accepting proposals from eligible organizations across the world with an idea for how to use Llama 3.1 to address social challenges in their communities. Applications addressing areas including economic development, science and innovation, public service, and more will receive special consideration.

Regional Events

Over the past year, we’ve met with and learned from developers and other stakeholders that are already using Llama to address some of the challenges they and their communities face.

Building on those efforts, for our next round of Impact Grants, we’ll host a series of in-person and virtual events around the world to explore the new ways Llama 3.1 can address local community challenges, as well as to provide technical guidance and mentorship to prospective applicants. This will include programs such as virtual events and in-person hackathons, workshops, and trainings in Egypt, India, Indonesia, Japan, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Korea, Latin America, North America, Pakistan, Singapore, Sub-Saharan Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam.

Organizations participating in each of these events will be considered for a specialized award of up to $100,000 USD in addition to being considered for an open call award of up to $500,000 USD. We hope these events will facilitate the development of applications of Llama to the specific economic development and social impact opportunities in local environments.

How to Apply

Apply to the Llama 3.1 Impact Grants by November 22, 2024!

Despite unprecedented progress in poverty reduction over the last 25 years, around 800 million people still live on less than two dollars per day, without adequate access to food, drinking water, electricity, mobility, and other basic services.

At the same time, many countries struggling with extreme poverty are currently among the most dynamic economies in the world, creating new opportunities to use innovative approaches to address social and environmental challenges.

The rapid expansion of mobile phone technology and solar energy have had tremendous impacts on development over the past ten years. Now technologies such as digitization, 3D-printing, block chain, remote sensing, and robotics might offer the same promise.

Living allowance for the duration of the research stay: 2.3 kCHF per month

Economy roundtrip ticket to and from Switzerland (max. 2 kCHF)

",Grant Amount: 15000 USD,https://ngobox.org/full_grant_announcement_Applications-Invited-for-Future-Conservationist-Award-Conservation-Leadership-Programme-(CLP)_12515,18/10/2024,"

About the Organization

The Conservation Leadership Programme (CLP) is a world-renowned training and capacity building programme that targets individuals from developing countries who are early in their conservation career and demonstrate leadership potential. As a partnership initiative between three of the world’s leading biodiversity conservation organisations BirdLife International, Fauna & Flora and the Wildlife Conservation Society, CLP focuses on building and enhancing the leadership capabilities of earlycareer conservation professionals working in regions with limited capacity to address high-priority conservation issues. Beyond providing financial support, the programme emphasizes ongoing mentorship, networking opportunities, and access to resources that enable awardees to acquire unique skills and advance their career within the conservation sector. This holistic approach contributes significantly to the programme's success in nurturing future conservation leaders worldwide.

Since 1985, CLP has supported and encouraged thousands of individuals who are early in their conservation career and are aiming to address global conservation priorities at a local level. CLP has and continue to be an important stepping stone for many individuals and its impact has helped to facilitate the discovery of species new to science, the designation of new protected areas, knowledge sharing and collaboration, and the creation of mechanisms for long-term conservation, such as the establishment of local non-governmental organisations and creation of conservation policy and action plans.

About the Award

CLP offers Future Conservationist Awards of up to US $15,000 each to develop leadership capacity of early-career conservationists who want to make a positive difference on the ground. CLP supports teams of individuals with less than five years of professional conservation experience, who display a strong commitment to conservation and demonstrate leadership potential. All team members should have a desire to be impact multipliers across the conservation sector with the ultimate goal of mitigating threats to biological diversity and transfer capacities to local people in the field. CLP unique approach consists of providing comprehensive training in the best and most effective tools, techniques, and strategies to lead and implement conservation action in their respective sites. Winners of these awards will develop key leadership skills through the management and implementation of small-scale practical conservation projects which can become eligible for continued support through CLP’s Continuation Awards and Alumni Network. CLP award winners also

have long-term backing and advisory support from CLP staff and partner organisations as they develop in their careers.

Eligibility

To be eligible for a CLP Future Conservationist Award, the team and project must meet the following eligibility criteria. Please read the complete Guidelines for more details on eligibility and judging criteria.

Team:

CLP Awards are for team-based conservation projects – each team must have at least three people.

All team members must be nationals of the country where the project is taking place. In specific cases one team member can be a non-national subject to clear justification of the expertise brought to the team.

All team members must be early-career conservationists with no more than five years of work experience in the conservation sector. ‘Work experience’ does not include research for a university degree. Individuals who have more than five years of work experience in the conservation sector are not eligible for CLP support and should not apply.

CLP is committed to supporting people regardless of their educational background. There is no minimum education required to participate as a team leader or team member, we welcome individuals with any informal, formal or non-formal education. The level of education of any team member does not affect your eligibility.

No team member can be a part- or full-time paid employee or contractor with a CLP partner organisation, including BirdLife International, Fauna & Flora and the Wildlife Conservation Society, at any time from project development through to implementation.

Any team member volunteering at a CLP partner organisation at the time of application and/or project implementation MUST be declared in the application. They also need to explain how the CLP proposal differs from the partner organisation’s work.

Applicants can participate in only one CLP project at a time and in no more than three Future Conservationist Award projects in total, serving as team leader for no more than one Future Conservationist project.

At CLP we prioritise diversity and inclusion. Supporting underrepresented groups in society is critical in our goals for conservation. We therefore strongly encourage applicants from historically marginalised groups and countries to apply, and for equality and diversity to be considered when selecting team members

Project:

The project must take place in one of the eligible low- and middle-income countries in Africa, Asia, the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, Eastern and South-eastern Europe and the Middle East.

",Grant Amount: 150000 USD,https://ngobox.org/full_grant_announcement_Applications-Invited-for-Climate-Change-AI-Innovation-Grants-2024-Climate-Change-AI-(CCAI)_12514,15/09/2024,"

About the Organization

Climate Change AI (CCAI) is an organization composed of volunteers from academia and industry who believe that tackling climate change requires concerted societal action, in which machine learning can play an impactful role. Since it was founded in June 2019 (and established as a US domestic non-profit on June 14, 2021), CCAI has led the creation of a global movement in climate change and machine learning, encompassing researchers, engineers, entrepreneurs, investors, policymakers, companies, and NGOs.

About the Grant

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can help support climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as climate science, across many different areas, for example energy, agriculture, forestry, climate modeling, and disaster response (for a broader overview of the space, please refer to Climate Change AI’s interactive topic summaries and papers). However, impactful research and deployment have often been held back by a lack of data and other essential infrastructure, as well as insufficient knowledge transfer between relevant fields and sectors.

The relationship between AI and climate change is also nuanced, and can manifest in various ways that either contribute to or counteract climate action. Thus, the use of AI for climate action must be performed with considerations of impact, responsibility, and equity at the center.

With the support of Quadrature Climate Foundation, Google DeepMind, and Global Methane Hub, we are excited to announce funding of up to USD 1.4M for projects at the intersection of AI and climate change. We are also grateful to the Canada Hub of Future Earth for serving as the fiscal sponsor for this program.

This program will allocate grants of up to USD 150K for conducting projects of 1 year in duration.

As part of the project, the grantees must publish a documented dataset (or simulator), which was created by collating, labeling, and/or annotating existing data, and/or by collecting, simulating, or otherwise making available new data that can enable further research. We require the dataset to comply with the FAIR Data Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable).

Projects are expected to result in a deployed project, scientific publications, or other public dissemination of results, and should include a carefully considered pathway to impactful deployment. All grant IP — e.g., the dataset/simulator produced and (if applicable) trained models or detailed descriptions of architectures and training procedures — must be made publicly available under an open license.

This year, there are two special tracks in addition to the main track. Submissions should be made to one of these three tracks (duplicate submissions made to multiple tracks may be disqualified). Climate Change AI may move submissions between tracks at the discretion of the Process Chairs.

Main Track

Projects in the Main Track should leverage AI or machine learning to address problems in climate change mitigation, adaptation, or climate science, or consider problems related to impact assessment and governance at the intersection of climate change and machine learning.

Relevant topics include but are not limited to the following topics:

ML to aid mitigation approaches in relevant sectors such as agriculture, buildings and cities, heavy industry and manufacturing, power and energy systems, waste, transportation, or forestry and other land use

ML applied to societal adaptation to climate change, including disaster prediction, management, and relief in relevant sectors

ML for climate and Earth science, ecosystems, and natural systems as relevant to mitigation and adaptation

ML for R&D of low-carbon technologies such as electrofuels and carbon capture & sequestration

ML approaches in behavioral and social science related to climate change, including those anchored in climate finance and economics, climate justice, and climate policy

Projects addressing AI governance in the context of climate change, or that aim to assess the greenhouse gas emissions impacts of AI or AI-driven applications, may also be eligible for funding. (Studies addressing this area may be exempt from the dataset publication requirement.)

For context, a list of the projects funded during past Innovation Grants cycles is available here.

Special Track on Methane

Submissions to the Special Track on Methane should leverage AI or machine learning to address problems in methane-related climate change mitigation in the short/medium term period (well before 2040), including (but not limited to) the areas of:

Energy (including coal mine methane, ventilation air methane, flaring, methane leak detection, super-emitters, and methane emissions from oil and gas)

Waste and circular economy (including food loss and waste recovery, food or organic waste separation, dumps/landfill emissions, wastewater treatment, and sludge management)

Agriculture (including livestock, manure management, biomass burning, and rice cultivation)

Special Track on Dataset Gaps

Submissions to the Special Track on Dataset Gaps should have, as their primary focus, the creation of a documented dataset (or simulator) by collating, labeling, and/or annotating existing data, and/or by collecting, simulating, or otherwise making available new data that can enable further research. Topics that may be addressed by the dataset or simulator follow the same scope as submissions to the Main Track, and applicants should highlight the particular gap in dataset availability that this project aims to address, and why this is important for climate change mitigation or adaptation.

Proposals in the Special Track on Dataset Gaps may also request support from a Google DeepMind researcher, in addition to the financial award. Applicants who may be interested in taking advantage of this option will be asked to indicate this in the CMT submission form.

Note: Proposals in the Special Track on Dataset Gaps may also propose research leveraging the dataset or simulator as part of the project; however, the primary focus of the project should be on the creation of the dataset or simulator itself. By contrast, projects in the Main Track must release a dataset or simulator but this need not be the primary focus of the project.

Eligibility

Principal Investigator must be affiliated with an accredited university in one of the 38 OECD Member Countries (see list here). Co-Investigators can be located outside OECD Member countries and can be affiliated with non-research institutions, and there is no limit on the fraction of funding allocated to Co-Investigators.

How to Apply

",Grant Amount: 400000 USD,https://ngobox.org/full_grant_announcement_Applications-Invited-for-Research-Practice-Partnership-(RPP)-Grants-Program-Spencer-Foundation_12512,31/10/2024,"

About the Organization

The Spencer Foundation invests in education research that cultivates learning and transforms lives.

The Spencer Foundation has been a leading funder of education research since 1971 and is the only national foundation focused exclusively on supporting education research.

About the Grant

The Research-Practice Partnership (RPP) Grants Program is intended to support education research projects that engage in collaborative and participatory partnerships with project budgets of up to $400,000 and durations of up to three years. We accept Intent to Apply forms once a year in this program.

We view partnerships as an important approach to knowledge generation and the improvement of education, broadly construed. Rigorous partnership work is intentionally organized to engage diverse forms of expertise and perspectives, across practitioners, scholars, and organizations, as well as disciplines and methods, in knowledge generation around pressing problems of practice and/or policy. Further, RPPs can facilitate the long-term accumulation of knowledge in new ways as researchers and practitioners work together to ask practitioner- and policy-relevant questions on key topics in specific settings over time. Many key problems of practice and policy are historically saturated and require multiple perspectives and long-term engagement if sustainable and systemic change is to occur. Over the long term, we anticipate that research conducted by RPPs will result in new insights into the processes, practices, routines, and policies that improve education for learners, educators, families, communities, and institutions where learning and teaching happen (e.g., schools, universities, community centers, parks, museums, other workplaces).

This grant program is open to existing partnerships between researchers and a broad array of practitioners. For example, practitioners might work in school districts, county offices of education, state educational organizations, universities, community-based organizations, and other social sectors that significantly impact learners’ lives. As such, we define practitioners broadly; they might be policy-makers, out-of-school-time providers and other informal educators, K-12 teachers and leaders, or families and other community members. We are open to applications from design-based research teams, networked improvement communities, place-based research alliances, and a wealth of other partnership arrangements.

We expect the partners in the RPPs we fund to have engaged in fruitful long-term collaborations. How this history is evidenced can vary. For example, teams might have a track record of success as demonstrated by in-process or completed research studies, solutions-in-progress, established trusting relationships, or data-sharing agreements, amongst other possibilities. This grant program is specifically intended to build the capacity of partnerships to make educational change. Effective governance is a key aspect of successful partnerships, and as such, all proposals should specify their governance structures and how the work is jointly developed, as well as how power is shared, across all partners. As noted, while this grant program is open to all partnership configurations across a range of learning contexts, in addition to PreK-12 school systems, we especially encourage applications from partnerships that include scholars and institutions of higher education, rural geographic locations, and in locations outside of the United States, as well as partnerships that deeply engage community-based organizations and families.

Educational Equity

Importantly, we expect that partnerships will foreground issues connected to inequality in education and articulate how their project aims to disrupt the reproduction and deepening of inequities. We welcome projects that seek to disrupt inequities across a range of dimensions including (but not exclusive to) race, ethnicity, language, class, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, geography, political affiliations, religion, and (dis)ability.

Activities that May be Funded

Research is fundamental to every research-practice partnership, and we expect research activities to be the central element of every proposal. In addition to detailing a plan for research, applicants should also prioritize plans for communicating and disseminating key findings and other important partnership activities that have the potential to foster positive educational changes.

The following categories of activities are meant to be illustrative, but not exclusive, of activities in addition to the research that could be funded under this program. We expect proposed activities will be highly related to partnership type and context but will also, at their core, have the potential to make a contribution to improved educational practice and/or policy beyond the specific context in which scholars and practitioners are working.

Research Activities

Research Infrastructure

Outreach, Communications, and Relationship Building

Capacity Development

Eligibility

Proposals to the Research-Practice Partnership program must be for research and other activities aimed to support collaborative partnerships between academic researcher(s) and a broad array of practitioner(s) of education.

Principal Investigators (PIs) and Co-PIs applying for a Research-Practice Partnership Grant are expected to have an earned doctorate in an academic discipline or professional field, or demonstrated professional experience appropriate for this program. Note: If the PI or Co-PI from the practice/policy side of the partnership does not have an earned doctorate, they are expected to have appropriate professional experience to serve in this role in the partnership. While graduate students may be part of the team, they may not be named the PI or Co-PI on the proposal.

The PI must be affiliated with a non-profit organization or public/governmental institution that is willing to serve as the administering organization if the grant is awarded. The Spencer Foundation does not award grants directly to individuals. Examples include non-profit or public colleges, universities, school districts, and research facilities, as well as other non-profit organizations with a 501(c)(3) determination from the IRS (or equivalent non-profit status if the organization is outside of the United States).

The PI associated with the administering organization for this grant could be either the practitioner/policymaker or researcher of the partnership. At least one Co-PI should be from the other member organization(s).

Proposals are accepted from the U.S. and internationally. All proposals must be submitted in English and budgets must be proposed in U.S. Dollars.

About the Organization

The Spencer Foundation invests in education research that cultivates learning and transforms lives. The Spencer Foundation has been a leading funder of education research since 1971 and is the only national foundation focused exclusively on supporting education research.

Our Goals:

Invest in education research that is transformative, methodologically rigorous, and helps create a better society.

Support high-quality education research training.

Broaden the diversity of scholars and scholarship in education research.

Strengthen the impact of education research for improving educational practice.

Make education research more accessible to public audiences.

About the Grant

The Small Research Grants on Education Program supports education research projects that will contribute to the improvement of education, broadly conceived, with budgets up to $50,000 for projects ranging from one to five years. Eligible investigators may also request additional supplemental funds for a course release. We accept applications three times per year.

This program is “field-initiated” in that proposal submissions are not in response to a specific request for a particular research topic, discipline, design, or method. Our goal for this program is to support rigorous, intellectually ambitious and technically sound research that is relevant to the most pressing questions and compelling opportunities in education. We seek to support scholarship that develops new foundational knowledge that may have a lasting impact on educational discourse.

We recognize that learning occurs across the life course as well as across settings—from the classroom to the workplace, to family and community contexts and even onto the playing field—any of which may, in the right circumstance, provide the basis for rewarding study that makes significant contributions to the field. We value work that fosters creative and open-minded scholarship, engages in deep inquiry, and examines robust questions related to education. To this end, this program supports proposals from multiple disciplinary and methodological perspectives, both domestically and internationally, from scholars at various stages in their career. We anticipate that proposals will span a wide range of topics and disciplines that innovatively investigate questions central to education, including for example education, anthropology, philosophy, psychology, sociology, law, economics, history, or neuroscience, amongst others.

Moreover, we expect and welcome methodological diversity in answering pressing questions; thus, we are open to projects that utilize a wide array of research methods including quantitative, qualitative, mixed-methods, ethnographies, computational modeling, design-based research, participatory methods, and historical research, to name a few. We are open to projects that might incorporate data from multiple and varied sources, span a sufficient length of time as to achieve a depth of understanding, or work closely with practitioners or community members over the life of the project.

Eligibility

Proposals to the Small Research Grants on Education program must be for research projects that aim to study education. Proposals for activities other than research are not eligible (e.g., program evaluations, professional development, curriculum development, scholarships, capital projects, software development). Additionally, proposals for research studies focused on areas other than education are not eligible.

Principal Investigators (PIs) and Co-PIs applying for a Small Research Grant on Education must have an earned doctorate in an academic discipline or professional field, or appropriate experience in an education research-related profession. While graduate students may be part of the research team, they may not be named the PI or Co-PI on the proposal.

The PI must be affiliated with a non-profit organization or public/governmental institution that is willing to serve as the administering organization if the grant is awarded. The Spencer Foundation does not award grants directly to individuals. Examples include non-profit or public colleges, universities, school districts, and research facilities, as well as other non-profit organizations with a 501(c)(3) determination from the IRS (or equivalent non-profit status if the organization is outside of the United States).

Proposals are accepted from the U.S. and internationally, however, all proposals must be submitted in English and budgets must be proposed in U.S. Dollars.

About the Organization

The Munich Re Foundation was set up as a non-profit organisation in 2005. At the heart of our Foundation is Munich Re’s commitment to act responsibly and share knowledge. Based in Munich, our activities span the globe, primarily in emerging and developing countries.

Our purpose and vision:

We tackle pressing global challenges and develop solutions for people at risk. At the core of our Foundation lies a responsibility to enhance the well-being of communities through a deep understanding and adept management of risks. It’s not just about mitigating threats – it’s also about utilising the wealth of knowledge within Munich Re for the benefit of society.’

About the Grant

Recent decades have seen a significant increase in the number of catastrophes with devastating consequences. Disaster prevention is more vital than ever, and local projects show particular promise. The RISK Award, launched in 2012, will award up to €100,000 every two years to fund groundbreaking projects. It is jointly organised by Munich Re Foundation and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR).

The risks posed by population development, environmental and climate change are increasing. Complex technical systems and infrastructure are additional risk factors. The Award partners recognise the need to address this development. The RISK Award has been set up to help improve risk reduction and disaster management by providing financial support to projects dedicated to this topic.

We want to support innovative ideas, develop them further and help to scale them. Visibility, impact and enthusiasm should be embodied by the projects. Climate change, disaster risk reduction and sustainable development must go hand in hand to secure the future. For this reason, our projects are in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement, the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the Sendai Framework for Action.

The RISK Award, endowed with €100,000, is assigned to operational projects in the field of risk reduction and disaster management. The prize is awarded every two years. The endowment for the RISK Award is provided by the Munich Re Foundation. We use UNDRR's networks and platforms to inform on the topic, select winners, and organize the awarding ceremonies, – on site and online. Together, we can provide the winners the visibility their outstanding project ideas deserve.

Content:

The proposal must address the specific annual RISK Award topic.

The proposed project must include an implementation part (action), a proposal solely based on research is not sufficient.

The risks must be related to climate change induced or natural hazards.

Risks due to social turmoil, war, chemical disasters, and/or political crises are not in our scope.

We appreciate ideas to involve people at risk (people centred approaches).

We appreciate proposals which combine bottom-up approaches with top-down frameworks.

We encourage project teams which are engaged in multi-stakeholder partnerships (different sectors, different sizes, different organisational background, PPPs).

Who can Apply

It is expected that the successful project will be carried out by a team of people who have complementary skills.

It is perfectly legitimate to involve participants from partner institutions, but it is not advisable to form too large consortia for the purpose of submitting a proposal.

Research institutions, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and non-profit organisations (NPOs) are especially encouraged to submit.

The RISK Award mainly addresses projects in developing and emerging countries in the Global South. We therefore exclude projects that are positioned in high-income countries according to the World Bank classification.

The proposed projects must serve a non-profit or charitable purpose. For-profit initiatives are not eligible for selection.

The RISK Award is given to institutions or organisations. Unfortunately, individuals cannot be considered.

How to Apply

End of the 2025 RISK Award application phase: 13 October 2024.

35,Applications Invited for the Small Research Grants on Education Program ,"Spencer Foundation
",Grant Amount: 50000 USD,https://ngobox.org/full_grant_announcement_Applications-Invited-for-the-Small-Research-Grants-on-Education-Program--Spencer-Foundation_12480,11/09/2024,"

About the Organization

The Spencer Foundation invests in education research that cultivates learning and transforms lives. The Spencer Foundation has been a leading funder of education research since 1971 and is the only national foundation focused exclusively on supporting education research.

Our Goals:

Invest in education research that is transformative, methodologically rigorous, and helps create a better society.

Support high-quality education research training.

Broaden the diversity of scholars and scholarship in education research.

Strengthen the impact of education research for improving educational practice.

Make education research more accessible to public audiences.

About the Grant

The Small Research Grants on Education Program supports education research projects that will contribute to the improvement of education, broadly conceived, with budgets up to $50,000 for projects ranging from one to five years. Eligible investigators may also request additional supplemental funds for a course release. We accept applications three times per year.

This program is “field-initiated” in that proposal submissions are not in response to a specific request for a particular research topic, discipline, design, or method. Our goal for this program is to support rigorous, intellectually ambitious and technically sound research that is relevant to the most pressing questions and compelling opportunities in education. We seek to support scholarship that develops new foundational knowledge that may have a lasting impact on educational discourse.

We recognize that learning occurs across the life course as well as across settings—from the classroom to the workplace, to family and community contexts and even onto the playing field—any of which may, in the right circumstance, provide the basis for rewarding study that makes significant contributions to the field. We value work that fosters creative and open-minded scholarship, engages in deep inquiry, and examines robust questions related to education. To this end, this program supports proposals from multiple disciplinary and methodological perspectives, both domestically and internationally, from scholars at various stages in their career. We anticipate that proposals will span a wide range of topics and disciplines that innovatively investigate questions central to education, including for example education, anthropology, philosophy, psychology, sociology, law, economics, history, or neuroscience, amongst others.

Moreover, we expect and welcome methodological diversity in answering pressing questions; thus, we are open to projects that utilize a wide array of research methods including quantitative, qualitative, mixed-methods, ethnographies, computational modeling, design-based research, participatory methods, and historical research, to name a few. We are open to projects that might incorporate data from multiple and varied sources, span a sufficient length of time as to achieve a depth of understanding, or work closely with practitioners or community members over the life of the project.

Eligibility

Proposals to the Small Research Grants on Education program must be for research projects that aim to study education. Proposals for activities other than research are not eligible (e.g., program evaluations, professional development, curriculum development, scholarships, capital projects, software development). Additionally, proposals for research studies focused on areas other than education are not eligible.

Principal Investigators (PIs) and Co-PIs applying for a Small Research Grant on Education must have an earned doctorate in an academic discipline or professional field, or appropriate experience in an education research-related profession. While graduate students may be part of the research team, they may not be named the PI or Co-PI on the proposal.

The PI must be affiliated with a non-profit organization or public/governmental institution that is willing to serve as the administering organization if the grant is awarded. The Spencer Foundation does not award grants directly to individuals. Examples include non-profit or public colleges, universities, school districts, and research facilities, as well as other non-profit organizations with a 501(c)(3) determination from the IRS (or equivalent non-profit status if the organization is outside of the United States).

Proposals are accepted from the U.S. and internationally, however, all proposals must be submitted in English and budgets must be proposed in U.S. Dollars.

About the Organization

Velux Stiftung is a science-funding foundation based in Switzerland supporting forestry research in Switzerland and globally.

We put our support behind researchers who aim to transfer their discoveries to initiate change and create impact.

The foundation aims to contribute to sustainable change and impact for the benefit of humanity. While there are many important and unsolved topics in the supported funding areas, Velux Stiftung focuses on those ideas or challenges which are relevant and take an interdisciplinary, outside-of-the-box approach but have received too little attention from major funding sources and lack alternative funding opportunities.

We expect our grantees to be knowledge entrepreneurs, to have a clear vision of the impact their research could generate and how they can foster the necessary change. Velux Stiftung aims to support researchers who have the path to impact in mind and want to actively transfer their science-based knowledge beyond the academic community into action and impact. This ultimate objective determines which audiences need to be targeted, and in which form the results should be transferred.

About the Grant

This call for proposals in forestry research is focused on developing or integrating solutions for adapting to or mitigating climate change, promoting biodiversity, providing resilient ecosystems services while supplying sustainable forest products. We’re also seeking proposals that incentivize action and behavioural change, transforming the theoretical and abstract values of forest products and services.

Thematic focus:

Innovative and integrative sustainable forest management to develop and provide solutions for adapting to or mitigating climate change, promoting biodiversity, providing resilient ecosystems services and supplying sustainable forest products.

Incentives or tools for action and behavioural change towards sustainable forest management by transforming theoretical and abstract values of forest products and services.

Program goals:

About the Organization

The Laerdal Foundation was established in 1980 in collaboration with the University of Oslo to provide financial support to practically oriented research projects that can help prevent needless deaths from sudden cardiac arrest, trauma, and during birth. The Board will prioritize applications in the focus areas defined in its strategy, that are considered to have a high potential to improve patient outcomes. The Board further believes there is particular opportunity for helping save lives at birth in low-resource settings and have therefore earmarked 50% of the grants to the category Saving Lives at Birth in Low-Resource Settings. The Foundation shares the mission with the Laerdal company of helping save lives but operates independently from the Laerdal companies under the regulation of the Norwegian Foundation’s Act.

About the Grant

50 % of the annual appropriations have been earmarked for practically oriented projects that may help achieve the UN Sustainability Goal no 3, aiming at reducing both maternal and newborn mortality by 2/3 from 2010 to 2030.

The Board will be prioritizing projects relating to interventions on day of birth – including prevention of stillborn deaths. Applications that go beyond a local impact and have the potential to document long term practical value and stimulate developments also in other regions/countries will be prioritized .

Applications are particularly welcome relating to:

Innovative approaches to more efficient education and implementation

Collaborative initiatives relating to scale-up of proven concepts

Projects taking place in the Foundation’s focus countries: Tanzania, Ethiopia, Malawi, Bangladesh, India and Nepal.

The Board expects to fund up to 20 projects per year in this category, with a maximum amount of USD 50,000, with the average grant being around USD 30,000. The Board will carefully consider the realism of the presented budget, and whether this contains items that the Foundation according to this information is not funding. If the total expenses for the project should exceed the grant, the Board will consider the likelihood that the project can be carried out with required additional funding from other sources. Institutional overhead cost related to the project may be covered up to 10%.

Eligibility

Practical experience of the applicant(s) to deal with the special challenges typically found in low-resource settings, and a strong commitment for participation also from local partners, are other factors that will be considered.

How to Apply

Application deadlines are April 1 and October 1 each year. All applications must be submitted on the Foundation’s application platform.

About the Organization

The vision of the British Ecological Society is for a world inspired, informed and influenced by ecology.

Our mission – what we do to achieve our vision – is to generate, communicate and promote ecological knowledge and solutions.

We provide grants to promote excellent ecological research by supporting early career ecologists, help fund training & travel, and to communicate ecological science as widely as possible. In recent years, over £400,000 per annum has been awarded globally through the various Society grants.

About the Grant

Providing funding of up to £2,000 for individuals, teams and organisations to engage public audiences with the excitement of ecological science.

Engaging public audiences with the relevance and importance of ecological science and careers is vital.

This grant will support BES members to deliver independent outreach, public engagement and science communication activities that engage public audiences with the excitement, importance and relevance of ecological science or enhance the experience and skills of others to communicate ecology with public audiences.

The grant will support diverse formats that reach and engage public audiences in innovative, creative and impactful ways, whether through in-person events, digital formats, or physical resources.

All Grants must be for projects that meet at least one of the top-level BES aims:

Communicate evidence-based messaging for what ecology is, how nature works, and the use of ecological science as a solution to local and global challenges.

Raise awareness and public understanding of ecological careers, their relevance and importance, breadth, and diversity, and show that anybody can become an ecologist.

Share how individuals can take action to benefit the environment, themselves, and society.

Increase the ability of others to deliver the above aims through outreach and engagement activities.

Whilst all forms of outreach and engagement will be supported, the funding may have the greatest impact if the Grant particularly encourages applications for activities that achieve the following:

Pilot novel methods of communicating ecological sciences with public audiences.

Engagement which may stimulate dialogue with ecologists, inform behavioural change and action for both ecologists and the public, or encourage ecological career prospects.

Encourage interdisciplinary collaborations.

Produce engagement materials or outcomes others can use or benefit from subsequently.

Develop the skills of others in communicating ecological science with public audiences e.g., training.

Eligibility

The lead applicant must have a BES membership. The lead applicant should be the person who will oversee the project delivery and complete the final report.

Awards are open to individuals, teams and organisations across all experience levels to organise ecological public engagement events. Collaborations between two or more people are also welcome.

Your proposal must be aimed at a non-academic audience, and all projects must clearly demonstrate direct interaction with them. They should also show evidence of links to the research community at regional, national and international levels, where appropriate.

There are no restrictions on where applicants come from nor where they carry out their outreach and engagement work.

How to Apply

The deadline to apply during Round 2 is September 11th. You will be notified in late November regarding the outcome of your application.

Register Online

When applications open, register/log into our online grants system, complete your contact details, and navigate to ‘Your Applications’.

About the Organization

Heritage is our legacy from the past, what we live with today, and what we pass on to future generations. Our cultural and natural heritage are both irreplaceable sources of life and inspiration.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) seeks to encourage the identification, protection and preservation of cultural and natural heritage around the world considered to be of outstanding value to humanity. This is embodied in an international treaty called the Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, adopted by UNESCO in 1972.

What makes the concept of World Heritage exceptional is its universal application. World Heritage sites belong to all the peoples of the world, irrespective of the territory on which they are located.

About the Grant

International Assistance under the World Heritage Convention is a financial assistance granted to the States Parties to the World Heritage Convention, in order to help them protect the cultural or natural heritage sites inscribed on the World Heritage List or on the List of World Heritage in Danger.

Projects must be related to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List (for Emergency and Conservation & Management) or included in national Tentative Lists (for Preparatory Assistance).

Priority is given to the most threatened properties.

International Assistance under the World Heritage Fund can support projects falling under one of the following three categories:

Emergency Assistance:

Maximum amount: 75,000 USD

The purpose of Emergency assistance is to address ascertained or potential threats facing properties inscribed on the World Heritage List which have suffered severe damage or are in imminent danger of severe damage due to sudden, unexpected phenomena (eg. land subsidence, extensive fires, flooding or man-made disaster).

This assistance does not concern cases of damage or deterioration caused by gradual processes of decay, pollution or erosion.

Conservation & Management:

Technical cooperation -

To provide equipment or experts for the conservation, management and presentation of properties inscribed on the World Heritage List. For example, conservation works, preparation or update of management plans or risk-preparedness plans fall under this category;

To establish / revise national policies or legal frameworks on heritage preservation benefitting World Heritage properties.

Promotional and educational assistance -

Maximum amount: 10,000 USD.

To raise awareness and develop educational materials for the general promotion of the World Heritage Convention and the World Heritage List.

As a consequence, the promotion of a single site is not an eligible activity.

Training & research assistance -

To support the training of staff and specialists at all levels in the fields of identification, monitoring, conservation, management and presentation of properties inscribed on the World Heritage List, with an emphasis on group training. Individual scholarships cannot be funded and should be sent to UNESCO’s Fellowship Section instead.

This assistance can be requested also to undertake scientific research benefiting properties inscribed on the World Heritage List, or studies on the scientific and technical problems of conservation, management, and presentation of World Heritage properties.

Preparatory Assistance:

Maximum amount: 30,000 USD

The purpose of Preparatory assistance is -

to prepare or update Tentative Lists; the process to be followed for the creation / revision of a Tentative List can be found here

to prepare nomination files for sites inscribed on national Tentative Lists; or

to prepare requests for Conservation & Management Assistance.

Who can Apply

All States Parties to the World Heritage Convention are eligible in principle. Individuals, foundations, IGOs and NGOs are not eligible for submitting International Assistance requests under the World Heritage Fund.

International Assistance requests must be transmitted by a State Party National Commission for UNESCO or Permanent Delegation to UNESCO, or an appropriate governmental Department or Ministry. Individuals who do not represent one of these bodies are not entitled to submit requests for International Assistance.

States Parties in arrears of payment of their compulsory or voluntary contributions to the World Heritage Fund are not eligible for International Assistance. For example, for the 2017 cycle, it means that all contributions up to 2016 included have to be paid. The status of contributions can be checked on whc.unesco.org/en/world-heritage-fund.

Moreover, the Operational Guidelines outline that when funds available are limited and a selection has to be made, preference should be given to:

a Least Developed Country (LDC) or Low Income Economy (LIE) as defined by the United Nations Economic and Social Council's Committee for Development Policy, or

a Lower Middle Income Country (LMIC) as defined by the World Bank, or

a Small Island Developing State (SIDS), or

a State Party in a post-conflict situation.

How to Apply

International Assistance requests must be transmitted by a State Party National Commission for UNESCO or Permanent Delegation to UNESCO, or an appropriate governmental Department or Ministry. Individuals who do not represent one of these bodies are therefore not entitled to submit requests for International Assistance.

About the Organization

USAID leads international development and humanitarian efforts to save lives, reduce poverty, strengthen democratic governance and help people progress beyond assistance.

President John. F. Kennedy created the United States Agency for International Development by executive order in 1961 to lead the US government’s international development and humanitarian efforts.

U.S. foreign assistance has always had the twofold purpose of furthering America's interests while improving lives in the developing world. USAID carries out U.S. foreign policy by promoting broad-scale human progress at the same time it expands stable, free societies, creates markets and trade partners for the United States, and fosters good will abroad.

USAID works in over 100 countries to:

Promote Global Health

Support Global Stability

Provide Humanitarian Assistance

Catalyze Innovation and Partnership

Empower Women and Girls

About the Grant

Through a year-round grant competition, Development Innovation Ventures (DIV) sources proposals for innovations that address international development challenges and improve the lives of people living in poverty in developing countries around the world. DIV provides tiered funding to pilot, test, and transition to scale (i.e., grow to reach the highest number of beneficiaries possible) those innovations that demonstrate evidence of impact, cost-effectiveness, and the potential to scale.

DIV funds four types of grants. Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3 grants follow a tiered approach that aligns the funding amount to the strength of the evidence of impact, cost-effectiveness, and scalability of the proposed innovation. Evidence Generation grants are reserved for rigorous evaluations of already scaled or scaling development solutions that lack sufficient rigorous evidence of impact and cost-effectiveness. More details on each of DIV’s grant types can be found in the “Stages of Financing” section below. Please refer to the glossary at the end of the document for definitions of terms.

DIV takes a portfolio approach to impact, meaning it takes relatively small, high-risk bets on early-stage innovations that may generate varying levels of impact as they are piloted, and invests larger amounts of money in later-stage innovations that are better able to demonstrate impact, thereby maximizing the social impact of the overall portfolio. DIV is deliberately open to all kinds of innovations and all forms of innovators, in all sectors and countries in which USAID operates. Ultimately, DIV aims to help transition the best innovations with proven impact to scale to improve the lives of millions of people around the world.

What DIV might fund

DIV recognizes that innovation can take multiple forms. Some examples of development innovations that DIV may support include the following:

New technologies;

New ways of delivering or financing goods or services;

New business models;

Cost-effective adaptations to existing solutions;

New ways of increasing uptake of highly effective solutions, including replication and scaling to new places;

Policy innovations;

Social or behavioral innovations based on insights from behavioral science; and

Data collection and rigorous evaluation to measure the social impacts of promising innovations.

DIV partners with innovators to save lives, reduce poverty, strengthen democracies, respond to climate change, help people emerge from humanitarian crises, and more. DIV welcomes proposals from a broad variety of applicants, including local partners and private-sector entities to deliver greater scale, sustainability, and effectiveness of development and humanitarian outcomes. DIV also welcomes applications from organizations that have limited or no experience working with USAID.

Core Principles of DIV The following are core principles of DIV: (1) evidence of impact on improving lives of people living in poverty in the developing world, (2) cost-effectiveness, and (3) viable potential for scale and financial sustainability. DIV provides tiered funding based on an innovation’s demonstrated track record of and potential for achieving each of these principles.

Stages of Financing

DIV funds four types of grants, and applicants must meet the criteria for the relevant grant type, as detailed below. The first three types—Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3—align the funding amount to the strength of the evidence of impact, cost-effectiveness, and potential for scale and financial sustainability of the proposed innovation. DIV supports only those innovations that are at the post-prototype stage (i.e., the fundamental aspects of how the innovation works have already been tested). Applicants should apply for the stage that best reflects the current level of maturity of their innovation and do not need to enter at Stage 1. However, applicants must demonstrate in their applications that they have met the conditions of the earlier stage(s) prior to applying for a later-stage award. DIV reserves the right to consider innovations for funding at a different stage or amount than the applicant has requested, which may be addressed during a co[1]creation process after the application is submitted.

The fourth type of grant—Evidence Generation grants—is for rigorous evaluations of development solutions that are scaling or that have already scaled and lack sufficient rigorous evidence of impact and cost-effectiveness.

Given DIV’s limited pool of resources, it assesses whether a grant for a particular activity provides social returns that are competitive with likely returns from grants to other applicants. Accordingly, the more funding that an applicant requests—even within a funding tier—the higher DIV’s expectations for development impact, cost-effectiveness, and ability to scale.

To meet DIV’s requirements, many successful applicants form coalitions of partners with diverse skills and may also use or seek additional funding from other sources. Applications are stronger if they leverage non-DIV support and, all else equal, the more support that is leveraged, the stronger the application is. Additional support can take different forms depending on the nature of the innovation (e.g., a commitment from a developing country government to implement the innovation, a financial commitment from an external investor, in kind support, etc.).

DIV aims to be catalytic with its funding, which means that grantees should be able to achieve results after receiving a DIV grant that they would not have been able to achieve without that grant. Applicants should state explicitly why they are coming to DIV now and how a grant will catalyze their innovation.

Purpose: DIV funds Stage 1 awards to support the piloting of innovations in a developing country. Innovations at this stage are early in their development and require pilot testing to refine the basic model and establish real-world viability at a small scale. DIV supports only those innovations that are post-prototype and ready to be field-tested at the time of application (i.e., innovations that are still undergoing development in a lab or that are still at the idea stage are premature for DIV’s support).

Eligibility

Organization Type. DIV accepts applications from anyone, including businesses, social entrepreneurs, individuals, nonprofit organizations, researchers, and governments.

Geography. DIV supports innovations across all countries where USAID operates. A full list of countries in which USAID operates can be found at www.usaid.gov/where-we[1]work.

Sector. DIV accepts applications across all development sectors, including education, environment, energy, democracy, economic development, and others.
